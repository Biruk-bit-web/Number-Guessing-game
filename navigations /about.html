  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm Biruk Bizunehe, a dedicated and passionate front-end developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
    My journey into web development began with a simple curiosity about how websites are built, which quickly transformed into a deep fascination with coding and design. 
    Over the years, I have honed my skills to create responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites that provide seamless user experiences across devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    I specialize in building interactive user interfaces and enjoy bringing ideas to life with clean and efficient code. 
    From crafting elegant animations using CSS to solving complex problems with JavaScript, I take pride in every project I work on. 
    I'm also expanding my knowledge by learning React and exploring modern web development trends to stay ahead in this fast-paced industry.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond coding, I am highly detail-oriented and enjoy collaborating with others to turn ideas into reality. 
    My goal is to create websites and applications that not only look great but also solve real-world problems. 
    I believe that design and functionality go hand in hand, and my work reflects this philosophy.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about emerging technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and refining my design skills. 
    I’m constantly looking for opportunities to grow, both as a developer and as a creative professional. 
    If you're looking for someone who is passionate, curious, and ready to tackle new challenges, I’d love to collaborate with you.
